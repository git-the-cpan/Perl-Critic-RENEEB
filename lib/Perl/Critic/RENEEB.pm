=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::RENEEB - A collection of handy Perl::Critic policies

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Perl::Critic::RENEEB is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that
is used in my programming environment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rules included with the Perl::Critic::RENEEB group include:

=head2 L<Perl::Critic::Policy::RegularExpressions::RequireExtendedFormattingExceptForSplit>

I use split with regular expressions regularly, but I don't want to use the x-modifier there. So
I wrote this policy to check all regular expressions in my programs but those used as a parameter to split.
